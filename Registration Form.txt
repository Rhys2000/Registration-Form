1.
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.
<!DOCTYPE html>

2.
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.
<html lang="en"></html>

3.
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.
<head></head>
  <body></body>

4.
Add a title and meta element inside the head element. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and add the charset attribute with a value of utf-8 to your meta element.
<meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Registration Form</title>

5.
Nest a link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with a value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

6.
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form.
<h1>Registration Form</h1>

7.
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register: Please fill out this form with the required information
<p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

8.
The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is equal to 1% of the height of the viewport. This makes it relative to the viewport height.
It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh.
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}

9.
Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0.
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
}

10.
That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes, by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7.
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1B1B32;
  color: #f5F6F7;
}

11.
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.
<form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org"></form>

12.
The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.
<form action='https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org' method="post"></form>

13.
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.
<fieldset></fieldset>
<fieldset></fieldset>
<fieldset></fieldset>

14.
The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset.
<label></label>
<label></label>
<label></label>
<label></label>

15.
Add the following text to the label elements: Enter Your First Name:, Enter Your Last Name:, Enter Your Email:, Create a New Password:
<label>Enter Your First Name:</label>
<label>Enter Your Last Name:</label>
<label>Enter Your Email:</label>
<label>Create a New Password:</label>

16.
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.
As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other.
label {
  display: block;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
}

17.
Nest an input element within each label. Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon.
<label>Enter Your First Name: <input></label>
<label>Enter Your Last Name: <input></label>
<label>Enter Your Email: <input></label>
<label>Create a New Password: <input></label>

18.
Following accessibility best practices, link the input elements and the label elements together using the for attribute.
Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective id attributes.
<label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name"/></label>
<label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name"/></label>
<label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email"/></label>
<label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password"/></label>

19.
Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.
Give the first two input elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, and the fourth a type attribute of password.
The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site does not use HTTPS.
<label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text"/></label>
<label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text"/></label>
<label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email"/></label>
<label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password"/></label>

20.
The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.
<input type="submit" value="Submit">

21.
At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.
To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.
Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.
<label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" required/></label>
<label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" required/></label>
<label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" required/></label>
<label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" required/></label>

22.
Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.
<label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" minlength ="8" required /></label>

23.
With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.
<label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required /></label>

24.
Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account the user is opening.
Start by adding two label elements to the second fieldset.
<label></label>
<label></label>

25.
Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal or Business.
To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio".
<label><input type="radio"></label>
<label><input type="radio"></label>

26.
Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text: Personal Business 
<label><input type="radio" /> Personal</label>
<label><input type="radio" /> Business</label>

27.
You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time.
<label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Personal</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="account-type"/> Business</label>

28.
Currently users can submit the form without checking the radio inputs. Although you previously used the required attribute to indicate that an input is required, it won't work in this case because adding required to both inputs will convey the wrong information to users.
To solve this, you can provide context of what is needed by adding a legend element with text Account type (required) before the label elements within the second fieldset. Then add the checked attribute to the Personal input to ensure the form is submitted with the required data in it.
<legend>Account type (required)</legend>
<label><input type="radio" name="account-type" checked/> Personal</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Business</label>

29.
Follow accessibility best practices by linking the input elements and the label elements in the second fieldset.
Use personal-account, and business-account as values for the respective id attributes.
<label for="personal-account"><input type="radio" name="account-type" id="personal-account" checked /> Personal</label>
<label for="business-account"><input type="radio" name="account-type" id="business-account"/> Business</label>

30.
You need to confirm that the user has read the terms and conditions.
Add a label element. Inside the newly created label element add an input element and set the type attribute to checkbox. Make this input element required so users can not sign up without agreeing to the terms and conditions.
Add an id and for attribute with the value terms-and-conditions to the elements for accessibility.
<label for="terms-and-conditions"><input type="checkbox" id="terms-and-conditions" required></label>

31.
Add the text I accept the terms and conditions immediately after the input element in the newly added label. Then link the text terms and conditions to the following location: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/
<label for="terms-and-conditions"><input id="terms-and-conditions" type="checkbox" required />I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a></label>

32.
Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload.
<label><input type="file">Upload a profile picture:</label>

33.
Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
Next, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13 because users under the age of 13 should not register. Also, users probably will not be over the age of 120; add a max attribute with a value of 120.
Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try.
<label><input type="number" min="13" max="120">Input your age (years): </label>

34.
Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
Start by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then nest 5 option elements within the select element.
<select>
          <option></option>
          <option></option>
          <option></option>
          <option></option>
          <option></option>
        </select>

35.
Nest the select element (with its option elements) within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element.
<label>How did you hear about us?
          <select>
            <option></option>
            <option></option>
            <option></option>
            <option></option>
            <option></option>
          </select>
        </label>

36.
The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element: (select one)
freeCodeCamp News
freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel
freeCodeCamp Forum
Other
<option>(select one)</option>
            <option>freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option>freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option>freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option>Other</option>

37.
Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4.
<option value="">(select one)</option>
            <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option value="4">Other</option>

38.
The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and columns.
Users will be able to register with a bio. Add a label with the text Provide a bio: at the end of the fieldset. Add a textarea element inside the label element. Note that the textarea requires a closing tag.
<label>Provide a bio:<textarea></textarea></label>

39.
Link the applicable form elements and their label elements together.
Use profile-picture, age, referrer, and bio as values for the respective id attributes.
<fieldset>
        <label for="profile-picture">Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" id="profile-picture"/></label>
        <label for="age">Input your age (years): <input type="number" id="age" min="13" max="120" /></label>
        <label for="referrer">How did you hear about us?
          <select id="referrer">
            <option value="">(select one)</option>
            <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option value="4">Other</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <label for="bio">Provide a bio:
          <textarea id="bio"></textarea>
        </label>
      </fieldset>

40.
The textarea appears too small. To give it an initial size, you can add the rows and cols attributes.
Add an initial size of 3 rows and 30 columns.
<textarea id="bio" rows="3" cols="30"></textarea>

41.
To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.
Give the textarea a placeholder of I like coding on the beach....
<textarea id="bio" rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach..."></textarea>

42.
With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, to provide each submittable element with a name attribute. This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.
Except for the two radio inputs (which you have already named), give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing.
<fieldset>
        <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" name="first-name" required /></label>
        <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" name="last-name" required /></label>
        <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" name="email" required /></label>
        <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input id="new-password" type="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" name="password" required /></label>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Account type (required)</legend>
        <label for="personal-account"><input id="personal-account" type="radio" name="account-type" checked /> Personal</label>
        <label for="business-account"><input id="business-account" type="radio" name="account-type" /> Business</label>
      </fieldset>
      <fieldset>
        <label for="profile-picture">Upload a profile picture: <input id="profile-picture" type="file" name="profile-picture"/></label>
        <label for="age">Input your age (years): <input id="age" type="number" min="13" max="120" name="age"/></label>
        <label for="referrer">How did you hear about us?
          <select id="referrer" name="referrer">
            <option value="">(select one)</option>
            <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>
            <option value="2">freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
            <option value="3">freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
            <option value="4">Other</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <label for="bio">Provide a bio:
          <textarea id ="bio" rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach..." name="bio"></textarea>
        </label>
      </fieldset>
      <label for="terms-and-conditions">
        <input id="terms-and-conditions" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" required /> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a>
      </label>

43.
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.
Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body.
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family: Tahoma;
  font-size: 16px;
}

44.
Center the h1 and p elements by giving them a margin of 1em auto. Then, align their text in the center as well.
h1, p {
  margin: 1em auto;
  text-align: center;
}

45.
Center the form element, by giving it a margin of 0 auto. Then, fix its size to a maximum width of 500px, and a minimum width of 300px. In between that range, allow it to have a width of 60vw.
form {
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  width: 60vw;
}

46.
During development, it is useful to see the fieldset default borders. However, they make the content appear too separated.
Remove the border, and add 2rem of padding only to the top and bottom of each fieldset. Be sure to remove the padding from the left and right.
fieldset {
  border: 0;
  padding: 2rem 0;
}

47.
To give the fieldset elements a bit of separation, select them and give them a border-bottom of 3px solid #3b3b4f.
fieldset {
  border: none;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-bottom: 3px solid #3B3B4F
}

48.
The border of the last fieldset element looks a little out of place. You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class, like this: p:last-of-type { }
That will select the last p element. Create a new selector that targets the last fieldset element and set its border-bottom to none.
fieldset:last-of-type {
  border-bottom: none;
}

49.
It would be nicer to have the label text appear above the form elements.
Select all input, textarea, and select elements, and make them take up the full width of their parent elements.
Also, add 10px of margin to the top of the selected elements. Set the other margins to 0.
input, textarea, select {
  width: 100%;
  margin: 10px 0;
  margin-bottom: 0;
}

50.
For the second fieldset, you want the input and label text to appear on the same line.
Start, by giving the input elements in the second fieldset a class of inline.
<fieldset>
        <legend>Account type (required)</legend>
        <label for="personal-account"><input id="personal-account" type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline"checked /> Personal</label>
        <label for="business-account"><input id="business-account" type="radio" name="account-type" class="inline"/> Business</label>
      </fieldset>

51.
Select only the .inline elements, and give them width of unset. This will remove the earlier rule which set all the input elements to width: 100%.
.inline {
  width: unset;
}

52.
Add some space between the .inline elements and the label text, by giving a right margin of 0.5em. Also, set all the other margin to 0.
.inline {
  width: unset;
  margin: 0;
  margin-right: 0.5em;
}

53.
If you look close enough, you will notice the .inline elements are too high on the line.
To combat this, set the vertical-align property to middle.
.inline {
  width: unset;
  margin: 0 0.5em 0 0;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

54.
To make the input and textarea elements blend in with the background theme, set their background-color to #0a0a23. Then, give them a 1px, solid border with a color of #0a0a23.
input, textarea {
  background-color: #0A0A23;
  border: 1px solid #0A0A23;
}

55.
Currently, if you type in the input or textarea elements, you will not be able to see the text. Also, their height is too small to be easy to use.
Fix this, by setting the color to #ffffff, and setting their min-height to 2em.
input, textarea {
  background-color: #0a0a23;
  border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
  color: #ffffff;
  min-height: 2em;
}

56.
You want the select element to remain with a white background, but now it is not getting the same min-height as the input and textarea elements.
Move the min-height property and value so that all three element types have the same min-height value, and the select element still has a white background.
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family: Tahoma;
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1, p {
  margin: 1em auto;
  text-align: center;
}

form {
  width: 60vw;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

fieldset {
  border: none;
  padding: 2rem 0;
  border-bottom: 3px solid #3b3b4f;
}

fieldset:last-of-type {
  border-bottom: none;
}

label {
  display: block;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
}

input,
textarea,
select {
  margin: 10px 0 0 0;
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 2em;
}

input, textarea {
  background-color: #0a0a23;
  border: 1px solid #0a0a23;
  color: #ffffff;
}

.inline {
  width: unset;
  margin: 0 0.5em 0 0;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

57.
To style the submit button, you can use an attribute selector, which selects an element based on the given attribute value. Here is an example: input[name="password"]
The above selects input elements with a name attribute value of password.
Now, use the attribute selector to style the submit button with a display of block, and a width of 60%.
input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  width: 60%;
}

58.
With a display of block the submit button sits flush against the left edge of its parent.
Use the same technique used to center the form to center the submit button.
input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  width: 60%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

59.
To make the submit button look more in line with the rest of the form, give it the same height as the other fields (2em). Also, increase the font-size to 1.1rem.
input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  width: 60%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  height: 2em;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
}

60.
To make the submit button appear more distinct, give it a background-color of #3b3b4f, and a border-color of white.
input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  width: 60%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  height: 2em;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  background-color: #3b3b4f;
  border-color: white;
}

61.
Lastly, for the submit button, you want to separate it from the fieldset above, and adjust its width to never be below 300px.
Change the margin property to include 1em on the top and bottom, while leaving the right and left margins set to auto. Then set the width as described above.
input[type="submit"] {
  display: block;
  width: 60%;
  margin: 1em auto;
  height: 2em;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  background-color: #3b3b4f;
  border-color: white;
  min-width: 300px;
}

62.
Most browsers inject their own default CSS properties and values for different elements. If you look closely, you might be able to notice the file input is smaller than the other text input elements. By default, a padding of 1px 2px is given to input elements you can type in.
Using another attribute selector, style the input with a type of file to be the same padding as the other input elements.
input[type="file"] {
  padding: 1px 2px;
}

63.
Speaking of padding, the submit button is sitting at the bottom of the form element. Add 2em of padding only to the bottom of the form.
form {
  width: 60vw;
  max-width: 500px;
  min-width: 300px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding-bottom: 2em;
}

64.
Make the input for the terms and conditions inline by adding the appropriate class in the HTML.
<input class="inline" id="terms-and-conditions" type="checkbox" required name="terms-and-conditions" />

65.
Lastly change the text color of the terms and conditions link element to #dfdfe2 by adding a new selector in the CSS.
Well done! You have completed the final part of the Registration Form practice project.
a {
  color: #dfdfe2;
}
